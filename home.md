# About me

My name is **Nguyen Van Tue** (Tue is my last name), and I am an AI-engineer at VinBigdata. My research & engineering interests are mainly in the areas of deeplearning, especially **Nature-langugage and Speech Processing**. 

Before I joined VinBigdata, I graduated from the **Post and telecommunication institute of technology** with a bachelor's degree in **Computer & Science**.

# About the site

**Actually, I recognize the importance of networking and building connections within the data science community, and sharing knowledge is definitely one of the most important ways to establish oneself.**

Besides, I'm documenting my learning notes in this blog, as well as memorable moments from my life.

# Note 


In additional, I have just created this blog and  also have cloned the template web-page from [phamdinhkhanh.github.io](https://github.com/phamdinhkhanh/phamdinhkhanh.github.io). Perhaps there might be some duplicate contents which I missed to deleting from the old-branch. 

I will update my blog soon.
