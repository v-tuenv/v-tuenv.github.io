# Who am I 

My name is **Nguyen Van Tue** (Tue is my last name for purpose), and I am an AI-engineer at VinBigdata. My research & engineering interests are mainly in the areas of deeplearning, aspecially **Nature-langugage processing and Speech processing**. 

Before I joined VinBigdata, I graduated from the **Post and telecommunication institute of technology** with a bachelor's degree in **Computer & Science** and did my part-time job at VinBrain & VinBigdata too. Personally, I rate myself as a **hard worker**.
