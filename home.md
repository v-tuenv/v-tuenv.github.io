# Introduce

My name is **Nguyen Van Tue** (Tue is my last name), and I am an AI-engineer at VinBigdata. My research & engineering interests are mainly in the areas of deeplearning, especially **Nature-langugage and Speech Processing**. 

Before I joined VinBigdata, I graduated from the **Post and telecommunication institute of technology** with a bachelor's degree in **Computer & Science** and did my part-time job at VinBrain & VinBigdata too. Personally, I consider myself as a **hard worker**. 

For more information about me please refer to [this]({% link about.md %}), and welcome to my blog.

And also about my articles, please refer to [posts]({% link content.md %}).


# Content of the site

I want to share my experiments on some main theories:

1. Math & algorithms.
2. Machine learning & deeplearning core concepts.
3. Nature language processing.
4. Speech processing.

Also for AI-enginnering:

1. Optimizing model frameworks: TensorRT, Onnx.
2. Stabilizing & enhancing the performance of the AI model API: Triton serving.
3. Optimizing models for on-device deployment (e.g., low-resources).

Actually, I recognize the importance of networking and building connections within the data science community, and sharing knowledge is definitely one of the most important ways to establish oneself.


# Note 


Currently, I have just created this blog and  also have cloned the template web-page from [phamdinhkhanh.github.io](https://github.com/phamdinhkhanh/phamdinhkhanh.github.io). Perhaps there might be some duplicate contents which I missed to deleting from the old-branch. 

I will update my blog soon.
