# Who am I 

My name is **Nguyen Van Tue** (Tue is my last name for purpose), and I am an AI-engineer at VinBigdata. My research & engineering interests are mainly in the areas of deeplearning, aspecially **Nature-langugage processing and Speech processing**. 

Before I joined VinBigdata, I graduated from the **Post and telecommunication institute of technology** with a bachelor's degree in **Computer & Science** and did my part-time job at VinBrain & VinBigdata too. Personally, I rate myself as a **hard worker**. 

For more information about me please refer to [this]({% link about.md %}), and welcome to my blog.

Currently, I have just created this blog and I also clone the template web-page from [phamdinhkhanh.github.io](https://github.com/phamdinhkhanh/phamdinhkhanh.github.io). So perhaps there are some duplicate contents which I missed to delete from the old-branch. 

I will update my blog soon.


And also about my articles, please refer to [posts]({% link content.md %}).
